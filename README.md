# Ahorrando para el futuro 

I participated in this project some years ago when I was working as Front End Developer for this Digital Agency

I used basic technologies as:
* ```html```
* ```sass```
* ```jquery```
* ```some ui libraries as slick```
* ```bootstrap```
* ``` yeoman webapp as task runner```
